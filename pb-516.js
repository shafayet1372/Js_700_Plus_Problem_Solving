/* Matrix Subtraction
Two matrices must have an equal number of rows and columns to be subtracted. In which case, the subtracted of two matrices 
A and B will be a matrix which has the same number of rows and columns as A and B.

The result of the subtraction of A and B, denoted A - B is computed by subtracting corresponding elements of A and B.

Create a function that takes 2 x 2D array (matrix A, matrixB) as an argument and returns a 2D array (matrix C). C = A-B.

Examples
sub([
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
], [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]) âžž [
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
]
Notes
Treat strings of numbers as integers. */

    for (let j = 0; j < A1[i].length; j++) {
