/* Intersecting Intervals
Create a function that takes in an array of intervals and returns how many intervals overlap with a given point.

An interval overlaps a particular point if the point exists inside the interval, or on the interval's boundary. For example the point 3 
overlaps with the interval [2, 4] (it is inside) and [2, 3] (it is on the boundary).

To illustrate:

countOverlapping([[1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [4, 5], [0, 1]], 2) ➞ 3
// Since [1, 2], [2, 3] and [1, 3] all overlap with point 2.
Examples
countOverlapping([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]], 5) ➞ 0

countOverlapping([[1, 2], [5, 6], [5, 7]], 5) ➞ 2

countOverlapping([[1, 2], [5, 8], [6, 9]], 7) ➞ 2
Notes
Each interval is represented as an array with a start point and an endpoint.
Intervals count as intersecting even if they only intersect at one point, i.e. [2, 3] and [3, 4] both intersect at point 3.
If it's helpful, you can draw these intervals on a line on a piece of paper. */




function countOverlapping(intervals, point) {
  let counter = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    let [a, b] = intervals[i]
    if (point >= a && point <= b) {
      counter++
    }
  }
  return counter
}

console.log(countOverlapping([[1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [4, 5], [0, 1]], 2))
