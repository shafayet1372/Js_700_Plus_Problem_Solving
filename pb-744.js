/* ðŸ’¥repeatedrepeatedrepeatedðŸ’¥
This challenge concerns strings such as:

"repeatedrepeatedrepeated"
... that are obtained by repeating a smaller string, which in this case is the string "repeated".

On a related note, since the string above is made of 3 repetitions, one way to produce this string is via the code "repeated".repeat(3).

Write a function that, given a string, either:

Returns false if the string isn't made by repeating a smaller string or ...
Returns the number of repetitions if the string repeats a smaller string.
Examples
isRepeated("repeatedrepeatedrepeated") âžž 3

isRepeated("overintellectualizations") âžž False

isRepeated("nononononononononononono") âžž 12

isRepeated("moremoremoremoremoremore") âžž 6

isRepeated(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,") âžž 24
Notes
To keep things a little simpler, all strings in the tests will have length exactly 24, just as in all the examples above. In particular, the answers will always be divisors of 24. */
