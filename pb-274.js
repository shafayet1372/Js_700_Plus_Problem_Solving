/* Find the Bug: Annual Price and Deposit Increasement
The annual price increasement needs to be done and we have written a script to migrate a product. An object needs to be returned with the old 
product and the new migrated product for pricing history records.

All prices need to raised by 15% and the deposit of bottles is increased from $0.15 to $0.20.

During the tests the old product seems to be the new product as well. Something is not working like expected.

Expected result
migrateProduct({
  product: "Milk",
  price: 1.2,
  containers: [
    { type: "bottle", deposit: 0.15, liters: 1.5 },
    { type: "can", deposit: 0.1, liters: 0.33 },
    { type: "carton", deposit: null, liters: 1 }
  ]
}) âžž {
  oldProduct: {
    product: "Milk",
    price: 1.2,
    containers: [
      { type: "bottle", deposit: 0.15, liters: 1.5 },
      { type: "can", deposit: 0.1, liters: 0.33 },
      { type: "carton", deposit: null, liters: 1 }
    ]
  },
  newProduct: {
    product: "Milk",
    price: 1.38,
    containers: [
      { type: "bottle", deposit: 0.2, liters: 1.5 },
      { type: "can", deposit: 0.1, liters: 0.33 },
      { type: "carton", deposit: null, liters: 1 }
