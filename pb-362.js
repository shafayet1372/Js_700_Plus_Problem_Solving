/* Snail Race
Steve and Maurice have racing snails. They each have three, a slow s, medium m and fast f one. Although Steve's snails are all a bit stronger 
than Maurice's, Maurice has a trick up his sleeve. His plan is

Round 1: [s, f] Sacrifice his slowest snail against Steve's fastest.
Round 2: [m, s] Use his middle snail against Steve's slowest.
Round 3: [f, m] Use his fastest snail against Steve's middle.
Create a function that determines whether Maurice's plan will work by outputting true if Maurice wins 2/3 games.

The function inputs:

Array 1: [s, m, f] for Maurice.
Array 2: [s, m, f] for Steve.
Examples
mauriceWins([3, 5, 10], [4, 7, 11]) ➞ true
// Since the matches are (3, 11), (5, 4) and (10, 7), Maurice wins 2 out of 3.

mauriceWins([6, 8, 9], [7, 12, 14]) ➞ false
// Since the matches are (6, 14), (8, 7) and (9, 12), Steve wins 2 out of 3.

mauriceWins([1, 8, 20], [2, 9, 100]) ➞ true
Notes
Maurice wins if his competing snail's speed strictly exceeds Steve's snail's speed.
Steve will always play in this order: [f, s, m].
The order you'll get the snails is always in ascending orde */
